## GDP Growth Forecasting under Economic Volatility

**Project Overview**
This honours research project evaluates the performance of traditional time series models for forecasting GDP growth in an economy experiencing extreme volatility. Using Zimbabwe (2000–2023) as a natural experiment, the study compares ARIMA, Holt’s Exponential Smoothing, and Vector Error Correction Models across stable, transitional, and unstable economic regimes.

**Key Contributions**

Expanding-window, multi-horizon forecasting framework

Regime-specific performance evaluation

Rolling cointegration analysis revealing structural model failure during instability

Evidence-based guidance for model selection in developing economies

**Methods**

ARIMA (univariate)

Holt’s Exponential Smoothing

VECM (GDP–CPI)

Evaluation: MAE, RMSE, MSE, MAPE

Statistical validation: Diebold-Mariano, Wilcoxon, Sign tests

**Key Findings**

No single model dominates across all regimes

ARIMA most reliable during instability

Holt’s performs best in short-term stable periods

VECM fails catastrophically when cointegration assumptions collapse
